Dear Potential Employer,
<br>
I recently came across a listing for a full time Environmental Research & Development opening with your company via Northeastern’s job portal. I truly feel that I am a perfect fit for this position - as your mission of making the world a better place with technology is something that I’ve strived for ever since I was a kid. I take a lot of pride in my work, especially when it results in the benefit in the lives of others, or the benefit of our society as a whole. Your company’s commitment to research in the fight against climate change is a challenge I would be honored to take part in. I believe that my personal and professional experiences would make me a huge asset to your company.
<br>
I will be graduating with a degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University at the end of June, which has been a great ride and provided me with valuable learning experiences. My first co-op was at a small company called clypd, inc - an advertising startup in Somerville, MA. While the motive of the company was not necessarily in line with my goal of helping others, it taught me so much about communicating with people of different backgrounds, experience, and areas of expertise. By the end of my first there, I was operating with all the responsibilities and tasks of a full time employee a challenge that was tough but one that I’m very grateful for.
<br>
One experience in particular at Northeastern that stands out as more in-tune with your ideology is that I was assigned to develop an application with the Boston City Hall. The city wanted a portal that would act as a place where they could list new volunteer opportunities, and have a network of local professionals to reach out to. Myself and a team of fellow students collaborated with a committee from the City Hall and build this application in the hopes of getting more of Boston’s researchers, professors, or working professionals involved in projects for the community. The City Hall took so much interest in our application that they hired someone to take over its development and upkeep permanently. Even though this was a relatively small project, I found myself really enamored with it’s potential to streamline volunteer projects and hopefully get more people to take part in community projects.
<br>
This position really jumps out to me as something I would love to do, and I sincerely appreciate your consideration. If you would like to contact me directly and discuss things further, please reach out.
<br> 
<br>
Sincerely,
Matt
